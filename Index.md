Hi, I’m **Alberta Petiafo**.  

I’m currently a graduate student at Ashesi University pursuing an MSc in Mechatronics Engineering. I earned my Bachelor's degree from KNUST, Ghana.

Beyond academics, I am passionate about volunteering work, especially initiatives that involve sharing knowledge about emerging technologies.  

Outside of engineering, I enjoy cooking, trying out diverse cuisines and spending time in nature through sightseeing and outdoor adventures.
